`aeacus` is a vulnerability scoring engine for Windows and Linux, with an emphasis on simplicity.

## V2

`aeacus` has recently been updated to version 2.0.0! To view the breaking changes, refer to [./docs/v2.md](./docs/v2.md).

## Installation

0. **Extract the release** into `/opt/aeacus` (Linux) or `C:\aeacus\` (Windows).

	> Try compiling it yourself! Or, you can [download the releases here](https://github.com/elysium-suite/aeacus/releases).

1. **Set up the environment.**

	- Put your **config** in `/opt/aeacus/scoring.conf` or`C:\aeacus\scoring.conf`.

		- _Don't have a config? See the example below._

	- Put your **README data** in `ReadMe.conf`.

2. **Check that your config is valid.**

```
./aeacus --verbose check
```

> Check out what you can do with `aeacus` with `./aeacus --help`!

3. **Score the image with the current config to verify your checks work as expected.**

```
./aeacus --verbose score
```

> The TeamID is read from `/opt/aeacus/TeamID.txt` or `C:\aeacus\TeamID.txt`.

4. **Prepare the image for release.**

> **WARNING**: This will remove `scoring.conf`. Back it up somewhere if you want to save it! It will also remove the `aeacus` executable and other sensitive files.

```
./aeacus --verbose release
```

## Features

-   Robust yet simple vulnerability scorer
-   Image preparation (cleanup, README, etc)
-   Remote score reporting

> Note: `aeacus` ships with weak crypto on purpose. You should implement your own crypto functions if you want to make it harder to crack with static analysis. See [Adding Crypto](/docs/crypto.md) for more information.

## Compiling

Only Linux development environments are officially supported. Ubuntu virtual machines work great.

Make sure you have a recent version of `go` installed, as well as `git` and `make`. If you want to compile Windows and Linux, install all dependencies using `go get -v -d -t ./...`. Then to compile, use `go build`, OR make:

- Building for `Linux`: `make lin`
- Building for `Windows`: `make win`

### Development

If you're developing for `aeacus`, compile with these commands to leave debug symbols in the binaries:

- Building for `Linux`: `make lin-dev`
- Building for `Windows`: `make win-dev`

### Releases

You can build release files (e.g., `aeacus-linux.zip`). These will have auto-randomized `crypto.go` files.

- Building both platforms: `make release`

## Documentation

All checks (with examples and notes) [are documented here](docs/checks.md).

Other documentation:
- [Non-Check Scoring Configuration](docs/config.md)
- [Crypto](docs/crypto.md)
- [Security Model](docs/security.md)
- [Remote Reporting](docs/remote.md)
- [Windows Security Policy](docs/securitypolicy.md)

## Remote Endpoint

Set the `remote` field in the configuration, and your image will use remote scoring. If you want remote scoring, you will need to host a remote scoring endpoint. The authors of this project recommend using [sarpedon](https://github.com/elysium-suite/sarpedon). See [this example remote configuration for Linux aeacus](docs/examples/linux-remote.conf).

## Configuration

The configuration is written in TOML. Here is a minimal example:

```toml
name = "ubuntu-18-supercool"            # Image name
title = "CoolCyberStuff Practice Round" # Round title
os = "Ubuntu 18.04"                     # OS, used for README
user = "coolUser"                       # Main user for the image

# Set the aeacus version of this scoring file. Set this to the version
# of aeacus you are using. This is used to make sure your configuration,
# if re-used, is compatible with the version of aeacus being used.
#
# You can print your version of aeacus with ./aeacus version.
version = "2.0.6"

[[check]]
message = "Removed insecure sudoers rule"
points = 10

	[[check.pass]]
	type = "FileContainsNot"
	path = "/etc/sudoers"
	value = "NOPASSWD"

[[check]]
# If no message is specified, one is auto-generated
points = 20

	[[check.pass]]
	type = "PathExistsNot"
	path = "/usr/bin/ufw-backdoor"

	[[check.pass]]       # You can code multiple pass conditions, but
	type = "FirewallUp"  # they must ALL succeed for the check to pass!

[[check]]
message = "Malicious user 'user' can't read /etc/shadow"
# If no points are specified, they are auto-calculated out of 100.

	[[check.pass]]
	type = "PermissionIsNot"
	path = "/etc/shadow"
	value = "??????r??"

	[[check.pass]]          # "pass" conditions are logically AND with other pass
	type = "UserInGroupNot" # conditions. This means they all must pass for a check
	user = "user"           # to be considered successful.
	group = "sudo"

	[[check.passoverride]]  # If you want a check to succeed when any condition
	type = "UserExistsNot"  # passes, regardless of other pass checks, use
	user = "user"           # an override pass (passoverride). This is a logical OR.
	                        # passoverride is overridden by fail conditions.

	[[check.fail]]          # If any fail conditions succeed, the entire check will fail.
	type = "PathExistsNot"
	path = "/etc/shadow"

[[check]]
message = "Administrator has been removed"
points = -5 # This check is now a penalty, because it has negative points

	[[check.pass]]
	type = "UserExistsNot"
	user = "coolAdmin"

```

## ReadMe Configuration

Put your README in `ReadMe.conf`. Here's a commented template:

```html
<!-- Put your comments/additions to the normal ReadMe here! -->
<p>
	Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW) is the only company approved Firewall for use
	on Linux machines at this time.
</p>

<!-- You can add as many <p></p> notes as you want! This HTML is simply imported into the existing ReadMe template. -->
<p>
	Congratulations! You just recruited a promising new team member. Create a
	new Standard user account named "bobbington" with a temporary password of
	your choosing.
</p>

<!-- Put your critical services here! -->
<p><b>Critical Services:</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>OpenSSH Server (sshd)</li>
	<li>Other cool service</li>
</ul>

<!-- Put your users here! -->
<h2>Authorized Administrators and Users</h2>

<pre>
<b>Authorized Administrators:</b>
coolUser (you)
	password: coolPassword
bob
	password: bob

<b>Authorized Users:</b>
coolFriend
awesomeUser
radUser
coolGuy
niceUser
</pre>
```

## Information Gathering

The `aeacus` binary supports gathering information (on **Windows** only) in cases where it's tough to gather what the scoring system can see.

Print information with `./aeacus info type` where `type` is one the following (NOTE: this is deprecated and will be removed in a future release):

### Windows

-   `programs` (shows installed programs)
-   `users` (shows local users)
-   `admins` (shows local administrator users)

## Tips and Tricks

-   Easily change the branding by replacing `assets/img/logo.png`.
-   Test your scoring configuration in a loop:
``` bash
while true; do ./aeacus -v; sleep 20; done
```
-   Set all .desktop files as launchable on Ubuntu+GNOME:
```bash
for i in $HOME/Desktop/*.desktop; do
    # Try "yes" rather than true on Ubuntu <20
    gio set "$i" "metadata::trusted" true
    chmod +x "$i"
done
```
