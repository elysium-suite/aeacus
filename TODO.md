# todo

- remote
    - status/time limit actually enforced
        - see comments in scoring.go and remote.go
- gui for ID (and checks, stretch goal)
- info
    - create list of admins/users
    - other things? esp for windows
- windows
    - fix windows service quit WaitGroup (phocus_windows.go)
    - reading TEAMID fails beacuse it's unicode by default and ioutil/program expects ANSI
    - as above, this is for FQs too. add ability to detect, or run through pruning function to remove null terms
    - ^^ THIS IS LARGELY FIXED. I count null bytes to detect unicode vs ansi. However, when the text read is only one character (for example, `b`), it will fail if unicode

- checks to implement
    - windows startup programs
    - windows and linux updates and auto-updating status (apt only for linux)
    - windows and linux password changes of users
    - windows and linux firefox checks
    - service-specific hardening and checks
        - do we implement this for linux or just let people use filecontains?
        - do we implement sysctl checks?
    - windows DEP

 - release
    - windows
        - Detect if firefox.exe is in x86 Program Files or just Program Files
        - clear run and command history
        - make owner of TeamID.txt the main user of the system, otherwise phocus posh gui wont write to the file
    - autologin user
        - see release_*.go
    - linux
        - clear ff history?

- hard/long term
    - verify binary
    - replace shell checks with lower-level more reliable things, winAPI, whatever
