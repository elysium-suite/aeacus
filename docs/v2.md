# Breaking Changes

- Checks now use semantic field names in `scoring.toml`. For example, the following FileContains check:

```
[[check]]
message = "Removed insecure sudoers rule"
points = 10
	[[check.pass]]
	type="FileContainsNot"
	arg1="/etc/sudoers"
	arg2="NOPASSWD"
```

Can now be written as:

```
[[check]]
message = "Removed insecure sudoers rule"
points = 10
	[[check.pass]]
	type = "FileContainsNot"
	path = "/etc/sudoers"
	value = "NOPASSWD"
```

Please see [checks.md](./checks.md) for a detailed list of all parameters.

- `FileContains` and `DirContains` use regex by default. `FileContainsRegex` and `DirContainsRegex` call these functions for backwards compatibility reasons as of v2.0.0, but these aliases may be phased out in the future

# Changes for Developers

- In order to call scoring functions, you must construct _or_ use an existing `check` and call the appropriate method like so:

```
result, err := cond{
  SomeKey: "value"
}.Method()
```

- The `cmd` structure no longer exists, so you don't need to call functions that resided under `cmd/` using the `cmd.` prefix when referring to them in `aeacus.go` and `phocus.go`
