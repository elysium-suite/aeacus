## Windows User Properties

These are the user properties that you would normally find the the user edit dialog.

__Usernames are case sensitive.__ `Yes`/`No` are not case sensitive. If you input something other than "yes" or "no" for a boolean check, it defaults to "no".

- `FullName`: Full name of user (case sensitive)
- `IsEnabled`: Yes or No
- `IsLocked`: Yes or No
- `IsAdmin`: Yes or No
- `PasswordNeverExpires`: Yes or No
